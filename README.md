# SafeSpaces Web App


A yelp type website where people can enter and comment on different safe or supportive spaces on campus i.e. minority spaces, empathetic professors, school resources for financial or career assistance, etc.People come into Wellesley from a lot of different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and it can be really difficult to understand the “language” of campus and how to find resources and support.

Right now, a user can view different posts and the comments on those posts, login/register to add or update entries and add or update comments, and delete posts/comments. I’m working on adding a star rating method, a user profile page, and easier to navigate design. Going forward I want to think about adding ways to moderate posts, categorize posts, and search for posts.

Run with node using the app.js file.
