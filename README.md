An interactive yelp-like web app designed for college students to share information about what resources they have found useful, particularly resources/people who have helped minority students learn about financial and emotional stability. 

Designed and implemented with RESTful routing conventions. 

Backend in: NodeJs, MongoDB 
Frontend in: HTML/css, Javascript, Bootstrap library

To Run:
  clone respository 
  in terminal: mongod
  in seperate terminal: node app.js
  
Right now, a user can view different posts and the comments on those posts, login/register to add or update entries and add or update comments, and delete posts/comments. Iâ€™m working on adding a star rating method, a user profile page, and easier to navigate design. Going forward I want to think about adding ways to moderate posts, categorize posts, and search for posts.
